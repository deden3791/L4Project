Additionally, it could benefit from more emphasis on important buttons. For example, the 'Start Listening' button could be better highlighted to show users to start the conversation, and perhaps the button could flip colour scheme when it's 'Stop Listening'. I think the web-app is really cool though, especially the ability to save settings and set trigger words."

For instance, save buttons having a different colour.

It would also help to add some padding around the buttons because for older people it can be harder to press on the buttons with as much precision due to the height being a bit narrow.

A recommendation that would help is asking people who fill in this survey what their technological experience is (eg. minimal experience like elders who don't use it much vs computer science students who are more familiar with tech): this could provide even more valuable insight to explain why some parts of the website are easy/hard to grasp.

Compared to other websites that provide similar services (eg. Eleven Labs), there are even more realistic voices that can capture tone and intonation very well, which can be very helpful to people who are hard of hearing as emotions can convey a lot of information. However, using these voices is definitely more practical due to costs (Eleven Labs can cost £100+ for its subscription for instance !).

This app would be made even better by taking inspiration from similar websites that are known to have very intuitive UIs. There's certain expectations about where items are positioned, the flow of reading, and more. So for some users theirs habits that have been built from using such apps thus it helps to follow similar in design to make it even easier to start using this app.

Having more font size options would have been helpful. For instance, instead of a selection box, a slider to increment the values might have allowed for more granularity.

I could hear the typing on the keyboard very audibly; it would be nice if there was a tick box that would drown the sound a bit. But I think for some people they might actually like the noise !

Overall, I think the web app is really helpful and it's really cool that it's open source. Thank you for making it !"

If there was also a section where you could have a conversation between two people, i.e. two text boxes and you click one when one person speaks and click the other when the other speaks could make conversations between two people easier, because you could tell who said what.
