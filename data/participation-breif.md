## Evaluation - Participant Brief

Hey! Thank you so much for participating in my evaluation for my honours project :)

The aim of this project is to develop a proof of concept for an affordable solution tailored to the needs of the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) community, leveraging the Web Speech API. By incorporating features such as speech recognition and text-to-speech conversion, the web application aims to foster inclusivity for individuals with various types of hearing loss. The primary objective is to provide cost-effective accessibility solutions while accommodating the diverse needs of the DHH community for the web-app to be usable. Furthermore, the project endeavours to create an open-source platform, enabling ongoing development and improvement beyond my own dissertation.

Hearing individuals are encouraged to use noise-canceling earbuds or headphones, when testing the web-app. This is intended to provide a modest simulation to assess the effectiveness of the web-app.

This survey will take approximately 30 minutes to complete, and is comprised of 7 sections, with an optional 8th section if you have time. 

During the evaluation process, you will engage in five tasks, each designed to familiarise you with a specific feature of the web application. Following your interaction with each feature, I encourage you to participate in a conversation facilitated by the web app. Subsequently, you will be asked a series of questions aimed at gathering honest feedback to enhance the user experience. Your participation in providing feedback is greatly appreciated and will contribute to the ongoing improvement of the web app.

It is very important to read through the user guide below, as it explains the tasks you have to complete. It would even be useful to have the window open whilst you are completing these tasks:
