### Evaluation Description

The aim of this project is to develop a proof of concept for an affordable solution tailored to the needs of the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) community, leveraging the Web Speech API. By incorporating features such as speech recognition and text-to-speech conversion, the web application aims to foster inclusivity for individuals with various types of hearing loss. The primary objective is to provide cost-effective accessibility solutions while accommodating the diverse needs of the DHH community for the web-app to be usable.

The assessment was distributed to individuals with and without hearing loss to complete 8 sections. Hearing individuals are encouraged to use noise-canceling earbuds or headphones, when testing the web-app. This is intended to provide a modest simulation to assess the effectiveness of the web-app.

Each participant was first encouraged to familiarise themselves with the app's interface before proceeding to the five sections, each containing a distinct task outlined in the provided [user guide](https://github.com/deden3791/L4Project/blob/main/main/UserGuides/UserGuide.md). Upon completion of each task, the participant is kindly asked to answer questions sharing their experience and feelings regarding the utilisation of the feature.

The evaluation intends to assess each feature against qualities such as:

- Intuitivity: does each feature feel intuitive?
- Accuracy: does each feature perform accurately?
- Comfortability: does each feature feel comfortable to use?
- Usability: is each feature usable?

### Data Gathering 

This project involved three user studies, which involved human participants. Please click here for the [Ethics Checklist](https://github.com/deden3791/L4Project/tree/main/dissertation/example_template/data/ethics/ethics-checklist.pdf).

All participants were given a [Participant Breif](https://github.com/deden3791/L4Project/tree/main/dissertation/example_template/data/participation-breif.md) before the evaluation began, which included:

- the aim of the project
- why we need participants
- what will happen in the evaluation
- what data will be collected
- how the survey will be opertated
- this was no a test of their ability
- they could withdraw at any time
- they must give their explicit consent to participate
- they can ask any questions

After evaluation, they were fiven a [Participation Debreif](https://github.com/deden3791/L4Project/tree/main/dissertation/example_template/data/participation-debreif.md), which included:

- the aim of the project
- they could ask more questions
- contact details
- appreciation for taking part

In order to remain GDPR compliant, all information was collected anonymously - participants are simply referred to as an ID number i nthe CVS file.

All results were gatherd via Microsoft Forms, and each survey can be seen here:
