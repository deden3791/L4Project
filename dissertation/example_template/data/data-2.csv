Why should Deaf people communicate in our second language, but hearing people's first language, when hearing people can't be bothered to learn our first language? Why do hearing people, such as yourself, assume Dead people want to communicate in English? Why do hearing people assume that Deaf people want solutions and fixes, when we do not have problems that needs fixing? This technology does exist to aid the Deaf person, it exists to aid the hearing person communicate with us. Read up on audism. "

1. Specifically relating to hearing aids, they are often far too vulnerable to moisture and frequently result in a staggered And ‘flow’ breaking Routines of having to frequently remove the hearing aids to tell them off/Wick away moisture around the earpiece/frequently making adjustments… (Imagine being in a meeting and frequently having to covertly remove your hearing aids to towel off the hearing aid while the meeting proceeds and sneak it back in and having to repeat that several times)

2. The exact industry term for this is escaping me, but, that “sound dampening protective thing“ where a computer tries to protect my hearing on my behalf and causes the volume to dip… Which I understand can be a fantastic feature for many folks… But for a hearing aid power user that began my journey in the 80s with analog hearing aids that just amplified everything and if I wanted to turn the volume down because of a loud noise I would mainly do so… So I would be fantastic if there’s a way that advanced users could toggle this feature off… I can’t play the piano anymore because the damn thing keeps behaving like a child that’s playing with the volume button turning it up and down… Or if I’m in a social setting and somebody lets up a high pitch squeal of excitement… Results in my hearing aids giving me a muted the sound for a minute by the computers trying to figure out when it’s safe to turn the volume back up. 

How do you spoken to a couple audiologist about these issues and they shrugged that most hearing aids are essentially made for geriatric populations that have to be reminded to wear their hearing aids… Not for younger folks who essentially wear them from the very beginning of the day up until they are in bed… I just wish that more assistive technologies kept younger demographics in mind. And I wish to have features that perhaps could be enabled by an audiologist that could allow a more advanced user to toggle on and off certain features that are built-in (including that weird silence followed by a series of beeps so you’re not “startled by the hearing a turning on“… I miss the hearing aid that she has turn on when you flip a switch)

Perhaps because the deaf community (I should say lowercase deaf, That do not sign) especially amongst younger demographics are essentially defeated with a world full of bad broken captions and hearing aids that are definitely not made for them… That it’s easy to forget that we exist but I would be interested to know what the actual demographic percentage that we do make up of potential hearing aid users"

They become very independent with their use. That is with both cochlear implants and hearing aids."

I cannot operate a mobile phone but use an iPad. Without live transcribe I would have to rely on lip reading and I’m not great at that .
